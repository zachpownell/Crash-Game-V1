# Crash-Game-V1
Crash game I created in 2014.
This is a game I coded in Java back in 2014. The code is pretty nasty, but I figured I'd create a repository for it for historical purposes.

The user starts with $100. 

When a new game starts, the user can gamble money and in hopes to pull their money out with the given multiplier. The multiplier will start with each new game, with a small percentage of crashing at 0x at the beginning, and the multiplier will go up progressively faster each iteration. 

It's pretty entertaining to play.
